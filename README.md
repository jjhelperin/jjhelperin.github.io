This is a project for a data analytics class that I took in Fall of 2020. This project was meant to be open-ended, and open-ended my project was. I did a plethora of things with baseball batting data, some of which I'm not even sure is entirely "correct" from a data analytics perspective. From what I understood from the project description, we were supposed to show that we knew how to go through the "data lifecycle," so I did things that I understood best. I received an A on the project (23.75/25), but you, dear reader, can decide for yourself how "good" my project really is.
